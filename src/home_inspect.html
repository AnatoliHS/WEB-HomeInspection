        HOME INSPECTION

    <div class="content">
        <h5><strong>Package 1 - Traditional Inspection</strong></h5>
        <p> A standard inspection primarily involves a visual examination of the accessible features
            of the property. Destructive testing is not permitted. The inspection is limited to what can
            be visually observed. This service is suitable for residential, commercial, and mixed-use
            residential/commercial properties. Each inspection includes a detailed description of any
            defects identified, documented in an electronic report that features pictures and
            illustrations.
            Pre-purchase Inspection
            This inspection is conducted on behalf of the buyer, typically after an Offer to Purchase
            has been made, with the condition that a home inspection must be completed.
            Pre-listing Inspection
            This inspection is carried out for the homeowner to identify issues and suggest
            corrective measures before listing the home for sale.
            The inspection will cover the following areas of the property:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> Exterior systems</li>
            <li> Roof systems</li>
           <li> Structural systems</li>
           <li> Plumbing systems</li>
           <li> Electrical systems</li>
           <li> Heating systems</li>          
           <li> Fireplaces and solid fuel-burning appliances</li>
           <li> Air conditioning systems</li>
           <li> Interior systems</li>
           <li> Insulation and vapor barriers</li>
           <li> Mechanical and natural ventilation systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h5><strong>Package 2 - Extended Inspection</strong></h5>
        <p> The Extended Home Inspection includes the use of advanced infrared camera
            technology. This camera can detect temperature variations that the naked eye cannot
            
            see, revealing issues such as moisture problems, heat loss, cold zones, and potential
            electrical faults. Infrared technology helps us accurately locate areas of concern,
            including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
            <li> Roof and ceiling leaks</li>
            <li> Plumbing leaks</li>
            <li> Water intrusion, including hidden moisture damage that could lead to mold</li>
            <li> Electrical issues, such as overheated wiring or circuit breakers</li>
            <li> Energy efficiency problems, like heat loss and inadequate insulation or ventilation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These temperature variations appear as cold and hot spots on our camera screens,
            exposing hidden problems that might otherwise go unnoticed during a standard visual
            inspection.</p>

        <h5><strong>Package 3 - Extended Inspection +</strong></h5>
        <p> Our Extended + Inspection, includes everything from the Traditional and Extended
            inspection packages, plus air sampling for mold spores. We collect one air sample from
            outside the home and another from inside (typically in a central area of the basement).
            These samples are then sent to a laboratory for analysis, where a report is generated
            that identifies the types of mold spores present, their concentration, and the comparison
            between the exterior and interior samples to determine if elevated mold levels are
            present in the home.</p>
