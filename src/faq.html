            <summary style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.01); "><strong>How long does it take?</strong></summary>
            <p>A standard inspection usually takes between 2.5 to 4 hours to complete from start to
                finish. For larger properties or those in less than ideal condition, additional time may be
                required.</p>

            <p>Absolutely! Your involvement is crucial. By being present, youâ€™ll receive real-time
                insights into any issues that arise, allowing you to fully understand the actual condition
                of the home before leaving the property. This also gives you the chance to ask any
                questions and gain clarity on the significance of any findings. When you receive the
                report later that day, it will serve as a comprehensive summary for you to review and
                evaluate.</p>

            <p>No, inspectors are not insurance providers. What we offer is our professional opinion
                about the home, drawn from our expertise and experience. However, this opinion is
                based on a limited visual inspection that is specific to the time of the visit. Issues that
                are hidden, inaccessible, or may develop over time fall outside the scope of the
                inspection.</p>

            <p>A Designated Substance Survey involves a visual inspection of the site to identify
                readily accessible areas where designated substances may be present in building and
                construction materials. During the inspection, we evaluate the type, characteristics, and
                
                condition of these materials. If necessary, samples of specific materials are collected for
                laboratory analysis.
                The outcome is a Designated Substance Survey Report, which details any materials of
                concern found on the site, includes lab analysis and test results, and provides an overall
                discussion of the types and locations of these materials. The report also offers
                conclusions and recommendations based on the observations and test results.</p>
